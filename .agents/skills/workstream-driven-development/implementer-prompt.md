# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template (Workstream Slice)

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent to execute a specific workstream slice.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Slice [Slice Letter]: [Slice Title]"
  model: [MODEL — REQUIRED: choose per SKILL.md model-selection guidance]
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Slice [Slice Letter]: [Slice Title]

    ## Slice Brief

    Read your slice brief first: [BRIEF_FILE]
    It contains the full slice goal, tasks, watch-outs, verification, and manual smoke test requirements.

    ## Context

    Workstream objective: [WORKSTREAM_OBJECTIVE]
    In-scope details: [IN_SCOPE_DETAILS]
    Carry-forward from prior slices: [CARRY_FORWARD]
    Additional relevant files/interfaces: [RELEVANT_CONTEXT]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies, schema details, or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the slice brief

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the slice specifies
    2. Follow `solopowers:test-driven-development` strictly: no production code without a failing test first
    3. Run the slice verification steps
    4. Commit your work
    5. Self-review (see below)
    6. Report back

    Work from: [DIRECTORY]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    While iterating, run the focused test for what you're changing; first verify RED, then verify GREEN, and run broader verification before committing rather than after every edit.

    ## Code Organization

    You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more
    reliable when files are focused. Keep this in mind:
    - Follow the key files and directory structure defined in the workstream
    - Each file/module should have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface
    - If a file you're creating grows beyond the slice's intent, stop and report it as
      DONE_WITH_CONCERNS — don't split files on your own without workstream guidance
    - If an existing file you're modifying is already large or tangled, work carefully
      and note it as a concern in your report
    - In existing codebases, follow established patterns. Improve code you're touching
      the way a good developer would, but do not restructure things outside your slice.

    ## When You're in Over Your Head

    It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I need more context."
    Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.

    **STOP and escalate when:**
    - You encounter architectural conflicts that affect other slices or packages
    - You need to understand code beyond what was provided and cannot find clarity
    - You feel uncertain about whether your implementation meets the core objective
    - You are stuck in a loop of failing tests or compilation errors

    **How to escalate:** Report back with status BLOCKED or NEEDS_CONTEXT. Describe
    specifically what you are stuck on, what you have tried, and what kind of help you need.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes before reporting back. Ask yourself:

    **Completeness:**
    - Did I fully implement all tasks specified in this slice?
    - Did I miss any edge cases, errors, or validation rules?

    **Quality:**
    - Is this my best work?
    - Are names clear, descriptive, and accurate?
    - Is there any dead code, commented-out logic, or debug logging?

    **Discipline:**
    - Did I avoid overbuilding and stay strictly inside this slice's scope (YAGNI)?
    - Did I follow the established patterns in the codebase?

    **Testing & Verification:**
    - Do the tests actually verify behavior (not just mocks)?
    - Did I run the specified verification commands and confirm they pass cleanly?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix and commit them now before reporting.

    ## After Review Findings

    If a reviewer finds issues and you fix them, re-run the tests that cover the amended
    code and append the results to your report file. Reviewers should be able to rely on
    your report as the test evidence.

    ## Report Format

    Write your full report to [REPORT_FILE]:
    - What you implemented (or what you attempted, if blocked)
    - What you tested and exact test results
    - **TDD Evidence** (mandatory for any DONE or DONE_WITH_CONCERNS status):
      - RED: command run, relevant failing output before implementation, and why the failure was expected
      - GREEN: command run and relevant passing output after implementation
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any lingering concerns or carry-forward notes for the next slice

    Then report back with ONLY:
    - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
    - Commits created (short SHA + subject)
    - One-line test summary
    - Your concerns, if any
    - The report file path

    If BLOCKED or NEEDS_CONTEXT, put the specifics in the final message itself.

    Use DONE_WITH_CONCERNS if you completed the work but have doubts about correctness.
    Use BLOCKED if you cannot complete the slice. Use NEEDS_CONTEXT if you need
    information that wasn't provided. Never silently produce work you're unsure about.
```
